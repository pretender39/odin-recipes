        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 cup finely chopped pancetta or bacon</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>12 ounces spaghetti or fettuccine</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add pancetta or bacon and cook until crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, whisk together eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with pancetta and garlic. Toss to combine.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing vigorously to coat the pasta without scrambling the eggs. Add reserved pasta water a little at a time to achieve a creamy consistency.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley before serving.</li>
            </ol>
